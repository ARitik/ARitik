I'm a software developer and a blockchain enthusiast. üåü

I am a Javascript developer working with the latest and greatest frameworks , the community has to offer. ‚ú®
I work on full-stack applications primarily on the MERN stack. I also experiment with PostGres and GraphQL for full-stack applications as well as Svelte for applications that need to be much more light-weight. I also write blog articles on [silica](https://spiritan.wordpress.com) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/aritik).
